# Reflection exercise

During lunch, reflect on and discuss the following:
* Are there any field-specific libraries you'd like to use?  How would you go about using them in your work?
* If you use tabular data in your own research, how would you approach translating that data into publication-worthy charts with pandas and matplotlib.
